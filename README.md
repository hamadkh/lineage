# History of Banday Family and Hazratbal

The Hazratbal Shrine is the holiest and most revered Muslim shrine in Srinagar containing Moi-e-Muqqadas (the sacred hair) of Prophet Mohammed (SAW). It is a white mausoleum with a large dome of marble and tall minarets rising on its sides. The mausoleum is also used as a mosque with regular prayers being attended by thousands of Muslims from many parts of the Valley. Hazratbal Shrine is located about 8 kilmetres from the city centre on the left bank of the famous Dal Lake, providing the Shrine a serene and splendid ambience. It has a beautiful garden on its Dal side, dotted with Chinar trees that provide tranquilising shade during the summers to those who visit the place.

The mosque contains strands of Muhammad's hair, often referred to as **"the relic of Hazratbal shrine"** or simply, "the relic". The relic was first brought to Kashmir by Syed Abdullah, a purported descendant of Muhammad who left Medina and settled in Bijapur, near Hyderabad in 1635.

When Syed Abdullah died, his son Syed Hamid inherited the relic. Following the Mughal conquest of the region, Syed Hamid was stripped of his family estates. Finding himself unable to care for the relic, he sold it to a wealthy Kashmiri businessman Khwaja Nur-ud-Din Eshai.

However, when the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb came to know of what had transpired, he had the relic seized and sent to the shrine of Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti at Ajmer, and had Khwaja Nur-ud-Din Eshai imprisoned in Delhi for possessing the relic. Later, realizing his mistake, Aurangzeb decided to restore the relic to Khwaja Nur-ud-Din Eshai and to allow him to take it to Kashmir. However, Khwaja Nur-ud-Din Eshai had already died in imprisonment. In 1700, the relic finally reached Kashmir, along with the body of Khwaja Nur-ud-Din Eshai. There, Inayat Begum, daughter of Khwaja Nur-ud-Din Eshai, became a custodian of the relic and established the shrine. Inayat Begum was married into the prominent Banday family in Kashmir, and since then, her descendants from the Banday family have been the keepers of the relic, known as Nishaandehs (literally: givers of the sign). Her male descendants belong to what is known as the **Banday family**.
